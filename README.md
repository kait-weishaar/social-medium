## Description:
Social Medium is an express-node back end for a social media site. It uses mongoose and mongodb for the database to allow for changing data structures as the app progresses. The data is structured around two models (three schemas) consisting of a user and a 'thought' (similar to a post). Users are also able to react to other user's thoughts. Lastly, it allows users to make and delete friends.



## Technologies
The Express.js framework was used for the API. The MongoDB ORM was used to ease the communication between the javascript app logic and the Mongoose database querying.  



## Installation:
A user must clone the repo, install the dependencies and run npm start to start the server.
